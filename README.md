# abruptly-goblins

This is my solution to the **Codecademy Learn Python 3** off-platform project, *Abruptly Goblins!*  This project involved organizing a game night: defining a list of would-be gamers' availability for gaming on different days of the week; defining the best night based on the gamers' availability; sending a message to all the gamers available to play on the chosen night; defining the best night based on the availability of the gamers who missed out on the first chosen night; and sending a message to all the gamers available to play on the second night.

This project involved working with:

- Python lists
- Python dictionaries
- Python functions
- Python loops
- Python strings
